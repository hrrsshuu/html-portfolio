<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a budding Full Stack Web Developer, eager to embark on a journey of innovation and
  learning in the dynamic world of web development.
  <br />
  <br />
  Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in a diverse range of web development technologies, from front-end
  languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end frameworks such as Node.js and Django. My coursework and hands-on
  projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in both client and server-side development.

<p>
  During my academic tenure, I actively sought opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I've collaborated
  on projects that required me to not only code responsive and visually appealing front-end interfaces but also implement
  robust back-end functionalities. These experiences have not only refined my technical abilities but have also instilled
  in me the importance of collaboration and adaptability in a team-oriented environment.
  <br />
  <br />
  While I may be a fresher, my passion for coding, problem-solving, and creating meaningful user experiences is unwavering.
  I am ready to bring a positive attitude, dedication, and a strong work ethic to any team or project. I'm excited about the
  opportunity to contribute to innovative solutions and grow both personally and professionally in the process.
